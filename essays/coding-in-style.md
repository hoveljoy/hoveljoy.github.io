## Coding standards... some indentation here, braces over there, etcetera
There are some widely followed coding standards, such as indenting lines of code that are inside of a loop. In general, these are stylistic, in order to help improve the code's readability. At the same time, there are variations depending on the programmer's personal preference. For example, exactly how big to make the indents, whether or not to vertically align a pair of curly braces, and what (if any) spaces to put around certain punctuation markings. In general, these coding standards don't make a difference to a computer reading the code, but they might make a difference to a person reading the code.

## You can become used to a certain routine
As coding standards are currently, a lot of variations exist, so there is no formal standard. In my experience, this is the culture in online coding examples as well as in classroom settings. Therefore, I feel that my peers and I have each become used to our own personal style of coding standards. 

## Coding standards and learning a programming language
I feel like the experience of experimenting with code on your own and having fun with it is a big part of learning a programming language, in terms of effectiveness as well as motivation. Furthermore, I feel like finding the style of coding standards that you like the best -- that feels most comfortable, seems the most attractive, and makes the most sense to you -- is part of that experimentation and fun. In other words, I do feel like finding your own style can help in your learning.
