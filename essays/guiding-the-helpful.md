# They're here to help. What will you say?
There's so much knowledge out there in the online software engineering community. For various reasons -- including gaining experience, tracking problems and developments in the industry, and just plain wanting to help others -- a lot of those knowledgeable people are active on engineering and computer forums and might help answer your questions. If you ask in an effective way, then you're helping them to help you in a more effective way. It's a bit of an art form; there's no perfect technique that applies to every situation. But, it can benefit you if you make your question more presentable and easier to follow. Ask your question in a certain way to help others think in a certain way, and you can guide them toward the type of answer that you want (assuming they hold such a relevant answer in the first place).

## Getting the help that you want
The key is how you go about looking and asking for help. It's good to first navigate to the correct forum for your question (ex. stackoverflow.com is great for programming-related questions). You can think of it as finding the right environment or grounds where you can set up your booth, stage your campaign. Essentially, you're trying to advertise for help, and you're trying to get the people around you to understand what you're saying.

Being polite is always good, and being concise and specific is excellent. It helps others if you say what you expect to happen (and, if applicable, what is happening instead). It's also helpful to say when you think the problem occurs (ex. what line in your code). If multiple events or problems happen, then it is most helpful to mention them in chronological order.
