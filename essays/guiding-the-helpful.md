# They're here and can help. 
There's so much knowledge out there in the online software engineering community. For various reasons -- including gaining experience, tracking problems and developments in the industry, and just plain wanting to help others -- a lot of those knowledgeable people are active on engineering and computer forums and might help answer your questions. You just need to ask? Or, is that all?

# What will you say?
If you ask in an effective way, then you're helping them to help you in a more effective way. It's a bit of an art form; there's no perfect technique that applies to every situation. But, it can benefit you in the end if you make your question more presentable and easier to follow upfront. Ask your question in a certain way to help others think in a certain way, and you can guide them toward the type of answer that you want (assuming they have such specific, relevant information in the first place).

## Getting the help that you want
The key is how you go about looking and asking for help. It's good to first navigate to the correct forum for your question (ex. stackoverflow.com is great for programming-related questions). You can think of it as finding the right environment or grounds where you can set up your booth, stage your campaign. Essentially, you're trying to advertise for help, and you're trying to get the people around you to understand what you're saying.

Being polite is always good, and being concise and specific is excellent. It helps others if you say what you expect to happen (and, if applicable, what is happening instead). It's also helpful to say when you think the problem occurs (ex. what line in your code). If multiple events or problems happen, then it is most helpful to mention them in chronological order.

Note this post on stackoverflow.com as an example: (<a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9271820/segmentation-fault-core-dumped?rq=1"> link </a>)

In short, the poster was concise and specific in saying what they were trying to do (print any value of their array's bits), what happened instead/what problem they were having (Segmentation Fault error), and just enough background for context (they're writing in C, and they included a snippet of code directly related to their problem). In this case, their code was already short, so they didn't have to worry as much about directing helpers to a specific line or block. It's more manageable for helpers if you can already offer a line or small snippet of where you think the problem occurs, rather than asking them to find it in lots of lines of code.

In turn, the poster received effective answers. One answer suggested what the issue to fix in the code might be (the array might be exceeding the stack size) and then offered a couple of solutions for the poster to try (making the array global or allocating the array using malloc). Another answer suggested an "indispensable" programming tool for C programming (especially when writing larger programs) and for the poster's problem in particular.
