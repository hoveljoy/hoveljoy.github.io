summary: A game that I made for my introductory programming class in 12th grade (senior year in high school). We were tasked with creating a game on the Scratch MIT website, which we had been doing algorithmic exerises on for a while up until that point.

In our game, I practiced the techniques we had been learning, such as processing keyboard and mouse inputs from the user, implementing a counter (to keep track of the user's score), and conditional loops.
